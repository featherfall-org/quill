## ðŸª¶ Quill

**Quill** is a book-inspired Roblox game framework inspired by [Sapphire](https://github.com/Mark-Marks/sapphire), designed to simplify your workflow's setup.

You can use Quill for Chapters (services/controllers) and Characters (components). Eventually, you will be able to use Quill to handle networking, data saving, and will be able to add your own extensions.
